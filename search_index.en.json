several years now, I use Qubes OS (https://www.qubes-os.org/).\nIt is an awesome general-purpose operating system, one of the most secure I was able to try and one I enjoyed using on a daily basis for all those years.\nIt really fits my basic needs such as browsing and coding.\nGaming might be a bit more challenging, but I didn't need it.\nAnyway, using Qubes OS when having strong security requirements is a no-brainer to me.\nAfter running it for a while, I realized that it might be a bit too much to cover my current threat model in regard to the constraints it involves.\nThe most annoying ones for me are the memory consumption and the fact it is complex to generate and configure my qubes [1].\nRegarding the former, I am usually doing several things in parallel, such as looking at bank accounts while browsing something for the house during a never ending coding session.\nAs all of this involves different security contexts, it takes place in different qubes and I often have to stop a qube in order to start another one due to lack of memory.\n8GB of RAM is definitively not enough for basic needs.\nRegarding the latter, I tried to play with SaltStack which is natively integrated within Qubes OS.\nNevertheless, it has limitations such as splitting qube creation from qube configuration and limited reuse, it involves interacting with dom0 [2] and have OS packages mostly tied to Fedora or Debian.\nIn addition, it requires a lot of maintenance, qubes generation are hard to reproduce and bugs are hard to fix because dom0 slowly evolves by design [3].\nThe objective of this series is to find a fully declarative and reproducible way to configure a rather secure Linux laptop.\nLet's be honest, it is also a pretext to play a bit more with current open source operating systems.\nFor sure, I might not be able to mitigate as many risks as Qubes OS does, but I might not need it as well.\n\n\nA qube is an isolated compartment in Qubes OS, so far implemented as a virtual machine in a Xen-based virtualization. ↩\n\n\ndom0 is the most trusted zone in Qubes OS and you should not mess up with. Having dom0 compromised means the entire system is compromised. ↩\n\n\nAs dom0 is the most trusted zone in Qubes OS, frequent OS updates can be a threat and dom0 will generally rely on an old Fedora version (see Qubes OS documentation for more details) ↩\n\n\n","description":"This series describes how I moved from Qubes OS to a completely different OS while trying to maintain as many security properties as possible.","id":"https://zzmzaw.github.io/posts/a-not-so-badly-secure-os-config/","path":"/posts/a-not-so-badly-secure-os-config/","title":"A not-so-badly secure OS config"},"https://zzmzaw.github.io/posts/a-not-so-badly-secure-os-config/01-choosing-the-os/":{"body":"I plan to move to another OS in order to smooth my daily digital life which mostly consists in browsing the Internet, developing and playing around with security challenges.\nIn addition, it has also to limit my risks according to my threat model.\nI will try to clearly describe what I expect from such a system and what kind of threats I may face so that I can ensure they are all covered as much as possible.\nI would like to emphasize that it is not a complete and fair comparison of all existing operating systems.\nThis analysis is tailored to my personal situation, and yours may and should be different.\nI would recommend using this article to help you identify your own expectations and threats, instead of as a concrete list to follow.\nLast but not least, this brief comparison is based on data collected from the Internet.\nAt the time of writing, I did not perform any experiments, and the outcome may differ from the expectations described here.\n\nWhat do I expect?\n\nGreat developer experience\nI spend a lot of time developing so the system must allow an excellent experience as a developer, including for mobile.\nBeing able to connect with an android phone is a must in order to keep mine up-to-date.\nI want this system to improve my development productivity in a reliable, reproducible and sustainable way.\nLast but not least, being able to test new tools, new libraries or new way of working should be made easy without putting the whole system at risk.\nBeing able to get rid of anything useless to me is a must-have.\n\nEasy to keep up-to-date\nI want to be able to keep the system running until I can invest some time to properly manage an upgrade or upgrade in a granular way a part of the system without requiring to look at the entire system.\nIf it forces me to upgrade, install and test again everything when I don't have enough time, I will end up doing the minimal quick and dirty stuff to be able to use the system with minimal capabilities.\nThe more I use it in this state, the less I feel motivated to invest time to upgrade it and, I just end up thinking about how to completely replace it with something better.\n\nFully configurable in a declarative way through text files\nI don't like GUIs... at least for configuring my operating system.\nI want to be able to write down in a text file what I expect from the system and let it configure itself to reach this desired state properly.\nAdvantages of text files are that they are easy to store, easy to back up, easy to share, easy to compare and their generation can be easily automated.\nCherry on the cake, if the system configuration is reproducible, it would make sure I can rebuild everything from scratch without worrying about it.\n\nMake software built from sources easy but only when needed\nBuild software from sources can really be time-consuming and become a nightmare.\nHaving an incremental build and relying on binaries caches is indispensable.\nSelf-hostable binaries cache is even better, even if it requires enough maturity to manage them (which won't be the case at first).\nNevertheless, from time to time, for an uncommon configuration or a specific tweak, building from sources can be really useful.\n\nAs much free and open source as possible\nI am fully in line with the \"Free Software Definition\" [1] and I do agree that open source is not always equivalent to free.\nNevertheless, I also acknowledge that I am not able, neither in terms of time invested nor in terms of money, to avoid using any non-free software.\nMy current situation is that I do my best to use a free software whenever possible and at least open source software.\nI may use closed-source software in places I am not confident to deal with (e.g. boot sequence, GPU driver ...).\nMaybe some day, I'll feel confident enough to invest more time and resources in getting rid of any non-free software I use.\n\nA simple threat model\nA threat is a potential or actual undesirable event that may be malicious (such a ransomware attack) or incidental (such as a computer crash).\nIn my case, the threat model will be contextualised to what could happen to my personal laptop, living in a place where I don't feel a risk for my life if I fail in securing it properly.\nThis has to be kept in mind not only while looking at this model but also while applying the configuration I'll propose as this may not suit your own situation.\nNevertheless, I'll try to move the security level above what is just require from this analysis everytime it is possible and remains usable according to my personal feeling.\n\nUnavailability due to laptop failure or destruction\nA laptop can break down at any time, whether due to wear and tear or an accident.\nAs I am focused on the laptop only, I'll assume data is properly replicated elsewhere and I am able to access it without it.\nI may cover data backup and recovery in the future but it is out of the scope of this series.\nAnyway, if my laptop becomes impossible to use, I want it to be easily reinstalled as it was once it is repaired (or replaced).\n\nData discolure due to laptop theft\nA laptop is considered a valuable object and can be the target of a theft.\nIf it happens, I want to make sure it will be if not impossible at least very hard to get access to the data hosted in it.\n\nSystem compromise due to Internet browsing\nI spend a lot of time on the Internet and I develop every time I can.\nThere is always a risk of compromise either by browsing directly or by downloading bad things (binary, code, dependency).\nIf it happens, I want the compromise to be limited to the browsing session with as few way to persist after a reboot as possible.\nIn addition, the compromise should be limited to a particular context (e.g. the development session) wihtout being able to easily spread to the entire system.\n\nChoosing my new operating system\nDue to the fact I would like a declarative and reproducible way to configure my operating system, I quickly end-up with the two following ones:\n\nNixOS (https://nixos.org/)\nGuix System (https://guix.gnu.org)\n\nThose operating systems are really similar.\nThey both rely on a declarative package manager to make system configuration reliable, reversible and reproducible:\n\nNixOS package manager is nix, relying on nix language\nGuix System package manager is guix, relying on Guile Scheme language\n\nAs there are already many comparisons between those two operating systems [2], I'll just explain why I chose Guix System over NixOS.\nThis choice is mostly subjective because both are great operating systems.\nYou just sometimes need to follow your gut.\nFirst of all, Guile Scheme looks cleaner than nix.\nIt is just my personal taste but as all the configuration will be done using one of those languages, it is better to feel at ease with it.\nNix has many more packages than Guix and they are more up-to-date.\nNevertheless, as most of my tooling is Rust-based, I expect it to be not so complex to compile (but I may be completely wrong).\nIn addition, it seems possible to use nix from Guix System which would allow taking advantage of the huge nix package repository.\nThe other way seems true as well, even if it might not be as interesting.\nBoth of them have binary caches which would allow to pre-compile software I use.\nGuix feels more unified and integrated.\nThis may be due to the smaller community or the slower pace of evolution, but it makes me confident I'll be able to follow and move only when I want to.\nI am not sure whether it is good or bad, though.\nBeing unified is good if enough is covered to be useful.\nI assume it is the case for Guix System.\nBy the way, I am a bit afraid that I may have to package too much software by myself, in particular non-free ones that my current laptop may require.\nBut I think I can give Guix System a try and fall back to NixOS if it becomes too time-consuming.\nWhat's more, if NixOS is not practical as well for me, I identified CachyOS (https://cachyos.org/) which is based on Arch Linux and may be faster to configure.\nEven if its configuration is not declarative, it seems security is a core feature alongside performance.\nBefore finishing, I would like to mention RedoxOS (https://www.redox-os.org/).\nIt is a completely new general-purpose operating system with a microkernel architecture under active development.\nUnfortunately, it is not mature yet for production use.\nIf its configuration is made easy and, even better, in a declarative way (let's dream a bit), it could become a fascinating operating system to look at in the future.\n\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html ↩\n\n\nI listed a few articles to start with.\nThere is no particular order and it is incomplete, so just

paper","id":"https://zzmzaw.github.io/posts/a-not-so-badly-secure-os-config/01-choosing-the-os/","path":"/posts/a-not-so-badly-secure-os-config/01-choosing-the-os/","title":"Choosing an OS according to expectations and security threats"},"https://zzmzaw.github.io/posts/a-not-so-badly-secure-os-config/02-preparing-guix-system-installation/":{"body":"Guix documentation is pretty well organized and complete.\nIt exists in multiple languages and formats.\nThe interesting point is that it contains a whole section on how to install Guix System.\nBefore starting, I strongly advise reading the limitations and hardware considerations.\nGuix strictly adhere to the \"Free Software Definition\" [1].\nThis means any non-free software won't be supported nor even considered worth discussing.\nThis point of view must be respected when interacting with teams maintaining Guix.\nNevertheless, adding support for non-free software is possible.\nFor Guix, it is mostly done thanks to the Nonguix repository.\nI would not be able to run Guix System on my laptop otherwise.\nI bought it a couple of years ago when I was far less aware about Free Software, but it is still working well until now.\nConsequently, I don't want to replace it yet.\n\nHardware considerations\nBefore going further, I want to know better the laptop I have in order to make sure it will be able to support what I want to do.\nThis paragraph will be updated according to all future articles to have one single place where all hardware requirements are listed to reach the end of the series.\nI currently use an ASUS Notebook UX330U with a Core i7 7500 as CPU, 8GB of RAM and about 500GB of SSD storage.\nLinux is already installed on it, so I know compatibles drivers exist for the most important hardware components.\n\nWill it work with free software only?\nThere is no chance that such an old laptop provided by a commercial brand such as Asus will be certified by the Respect Your Freedom program.\nIf you're looking for a new laptop, it might be a good starting point, even if the laptop list is rather limited for now.\nThe vendors' list can be used to browse more products and jump to others similar vendors.\nMinifree Ltd, not listed there at the time of writing, is worth mentioning even if I never used any of their product myself.\nBest solution for those who want to buy a new laptop to install Guix System on remains to browse the Internet with your favorite search engine and look for recent people feedbacks about it.\nIf, like me, you already have a laptop, you can search h-node to check how much it is compatible with free software.\n\n    \n    The h-node search page\n\nUsing the search capabilities is pretty straightforward:\n\nJust copy and paste the output of lspci -vmmnn in the analyze the output of the lspci command (as explained on the page) and it will list what has been identified and if it is compatible.\nYou can still click on the model name to get more details.\nJust copy and paste the &lt;vendorid&gt;:&lt;productid&gt; from the output of lsusb in the search by vendorid:productid and it will let you know if it is in h-node database.\nClicking on the model name gives you the details and if it is compatible.\n\nDoing so, you can verify supports for Wi-Fi adapter, USB controller, Bluetooth interface, Webcam, Fingerprint reader, ...\nWi-Fi adapter and USB controllers are particularly important to check as you'll need network during the installation to download packages.\nEverything else can be fixed after the installation if Linux compatible drivers exist.\nAnyway, the Guix System installer warns you in case it detects devices lacking of free firmware or free drivers.\nIn my case, I already know that the Wi-Fi adapter is not compatible with free software:\n\n    \n    The h-node lspci search result showing my Wi-Fi adapter is not free-compatible\n\nNevertheless, I have a USB Ethernet adapter which is compatible:\n\n    \n    The h-node lsusb search result showing my USB Ethernet adapter is free-compatible\n\nI planned to use it anyway during the installation, as Ethernet is faster than Wi-Fi at my place.\n\nPreparation of the installation media\nThe preparation of the installation media is made simple by following the section dedicated to USB stick and DVD installation from the Guix manual.\nWe can sum it up in 2 steps:\n\nGet the installation image\nCopy it to a USB stick\n\n\nGet the installation image\nThere are multiple ways to retrieve a Guix System installation image.\nChoosing the method you trust more is up to you according to your threat model.\nPersonally, I preferred the official one, as I had an alternative to the incompatible Wi-Fi adapter.\nAn OS image downloaded from the Internet should only be used after signature verification to make sure it has not been tampered with since it has been generated.\nYou can refer to the dedicated article about signature verification for more details.\n\nDownload the official image\nThe official image can be retrieved from https://guix.gnu.org/en/download/.\nIt is built by the team maintaining Guix and is the base for any alternative images.\nIt may be your preferred choice, except if you need non-free software for your network and you don't have any workaround.\nJust pick up the last guix-system-install version for your architecture (both x86_64 and i686 are supported) with the associated signature file (same name with .sig added).\nAt the time of writing, it is:\n\nhttps://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-system-install-1.4.0.x86_64-linux.iso\nhttps://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-system-install-1.4.0.x86_64-linux.iso.sig\n\n\n    \n    \n        Use the original repository\n        https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/guix/ redirects you to the closest mirror.\nIf you have any doubt about the mirror trustworthiness from a privacy and/or security perspective or the way you download doesn't support redirections, just use https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/guix/ instead.\nThis is the main repository provided by those maintaining Guix.\n\n    \n\nOnce image and signature files are downloaded, you can try to verify the signature before importing the key:\n\n    \n\n\n\nLet's download the key as indicated in the Guix System documentation:\n\n    \n\n\n\nKey fingerprint is the same, so this is the key which signed the image.\nThe key claims to be owned by Ludovic Courtès, but there is no way to confirm it through the documentation.\nSearching Ludovic Courtès with your favorite search engine should lead you to his Inria page among the top results: https://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/lcourtes/.\nInria is the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology, and I would tend to trust it.\nLudovic Courtès provides his GPG key's fingerprint on his page, and it matches the one of the key just above:\n\n    \n    The Inria page for Ludovic Courtès\n\nHaving two different sources pointing to the same key, I assume I can trust the key and so import it:\n\n    \n\n\n\nOnce the key is imported, we can now verify that the signature is valid:\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe image has been verified successfully, and it is now possible to copy it to the USB stick.\n\nDownload an alternative image\nIf the official image doesn't suit you for compatibility reasons, you can try to use the Nonguix one from https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix/-/releases.\nIt is built by the team (or the one) maintaining Nonguix, and you'll end up using this repository for any non-free software anyway.\nJust pick up the last nonguix-system-install version for your architecture (only x86_64 is supported) with the associated signature file (same name with .asc added).\nAt the time of writing, it is:\n\nhttps://substitutes.nonguix.org/nonguix-system-install-1.4.0.x86_64-linux.iso\nhttps://substitutes.nonguix.org/nonguix-system-install-1.4.0.x86_64-linux.iso.asc\n\nOnce image and signature files are downloaded, you can try to verify the signature before importing the key:\n\n    \n\n\n\nLet's download the key as indicated in the Nonguix release page:\n\n    \n\n\n\nKey fingerprint is the same, so this is the key which signed the image.\nThe key claims to be owned by Jonathan Brielmaier, but there is no way to confirm it through the documentation.\nSearching Jonathan Brielmaier didn't provide any insightful result, but searching Jonathan Brielmaier gpg should lead you to his page on Savanah: https://savannah.gnu.org/users/jonsger.\nThis page allows downloading his GPG key, which matches the key just above:\n\n    \n\n\n\nHaving two different sources pointing to the same key, I assume I can trust the key and so import it:\n\n    \n\n\n\nOnce the key is imported, we can now verify that the signature is valid:\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe image signature has been verified successfully, and it is now possible to copy it to the USB stick.\nThe only issue with this image is that it is refreshed only when a new Guix System version is released (which is not so often).\nAs I said before, I preferred to go with the official image, so I am not sure how easy it is to install Guix System using this image and if there are impacts.\nAt the time of writing, there is also an important notice for the 1.4.0 release requiring to manually import Nonguix channels:\n\n    \n    The important notice regarding Nonguix 1.4.0 release\n\nFrom tests I did, I was able to use this image raw without any configuration and the Wi-Fi adapter was working in the installer.\nNevertheless, I didn't go further.\nIf you want to follow this path, I would advise looking at the following articles:\n\nhttps://systemcrafters.net/craft-your-system-with-guix/full-system-install/\nhttps://wiki.systemcrafters.net/guix/nonguix-installation-guide/\nhttps://port19.xyz/tech/nonguix/\n\nIt is worth mentioning that System Crafters provides an installation image based on nonguix and refreshed regularly.\nIt is hosted at https://github.com/SystemCrafters/guix-installer, but I didn't check myself how it is built (not sure that I am able to anyway) and the image is not signed.\nWhatever the installation image you choose, the next articles of this series should apply anyway, as all rely on the same Guix System.\n\nBuild from sources\nThis is a path I didn't walk through (at least not yet) but you can find useful explanations in the official documentation about building the installation image.\nAs it requires Guix, you may need to first set up a live Guix System or install Guix on top of another Linux distribution.\nAnyway, once the image has been generated, it is now possible to copy it to the USB stick.\n\nCopy the installation image to a USB stick\nFirst, you need to know the device name of your USB stick.\nUsually, using lsblk is enough to identify your USB stick with following command:\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe USB stick I use is a 60G SanDisk Ultra Fit, so I know its device name is sdX.\nBeware yours may differ.\nIf it was impossible to identify the stick thanks to this command, it would be possible to use dmesg:\n\nUnplug the USB stick\nRun the command sudo dmesg --follow-new to display all the upcoming message\nPlug the USB stick\n\nOnce plugged, you should retrieve messages similar to the following ones:\n\n    \n\n\n\nWe can extract the device name sdX from the messages.\nWith the device name, we can issue the following command to copy the image to the USB stick:\n\n    \n\n\n\nDon't forget oflag=sync to make sure last bits are properly written to the stick (flush).\n\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html

important file is available for download, there is usually a signature file not far away from it.\nIf it is not the case, you should think twice before using the file you just downloaded.\nAnyway, when a signature is made available, you should take the time to verify it.\n\nWhy verifying the signature of a downloaded file?\nWe can consider there are multiple actions and actors when a file is made available for download and downloaded:\n\n\n\n    &lt;strong&gt;⚠️ JavaScript is required to render the diagram.&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n\nHow do you know that the file you downloaded is the one which has been generated?\nMaybe someone accessed the storage and modified it.\nMaybe someone is able to modify it on the fly while you download it.\nVerifying the signature is important because this is the only way to make sure the file has not been tampered with since it was signed, neither in its storage nor during its transfer, when you downloaded it.\nIn order to allow signature verification, a signature of the file is created with a private key owned by the file provider just after the file has been generated.\nThis operation usually happens in a safe place (at least as safe as possible) before the file is uploaded to the file storage, where it may stay unmonitored for a very long time.\n\n\n\n    &lt;strong&gt;⚠️ JavaScript is required to render the diagram.&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n\nFor sure, signature verification doesn't prevent the file to be poisoned before or during its generation or signature.\nIt doesn't prevent neither private key misuse nor abuse.\nNevertheless, those are all active threats which happen at a time when the file provider is usually careful about the file and this should be covered by the trust you have in the file provider.\n\nHow does digital signature work?\nSignature and signature verification rely on asymmetric cryptography [1] and cryptographic hashes [2].\nIt applies not only to a file but to any kind of data.\n\"Asymmetric cryptography\" just means we're using a key pair, a private key and a public key, to perform cryptographic operations.\nI won't go into too many details here, but you just have to keep in mind that asymmetric cryptography relies on the assumption that there is no way to compute or guess the private key from the public key.\nThe private key must be kept secret and used by only one person (or a small group) and the public key is... public and can be shared to anyone.\nCryptographic hash can be defined as a one-way function which transforms any input in a fixed-length unique output.\nIt relies on output uniqueness, whatever the input is and the assumption that the function cannot be reverted (you cannot compute or guess the input from the output).\nIf collisions exist (i.e. two different inputs generate the same output) then the hash function is considered weak and should not be used anymore.\nThe process of signing some data usually involves hashing it and encrypting the hash with the private key to create a signature, then providing the signature alongside the data in a way or another.\n\n\n\n    &lt;strong&gt;⚠️ JavaScript is required to render the diagram.&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n\nThe signature of the data can be verified by retrieving both the signature and the data, decrypting the hash from the signature with the public key, and hashing the data again.\nThe signature is considered valid if the two hashes match each other.\n\n\n\n    &lt;strong&gt;⚠️ JavaScript is required to render the diagram.&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n\n\nVerifying the OpenPGP signature of a downloaded file\nPGP [3] stands for Pretty Good Privacy and lead to the creation of the OpenPGP standard [4], which is widely used to sign and/or encrypt emails and files.\nVerifying the PGP signature of a downloaded file usually involves GNU Privacy Guard [5] also known as gpg (even if there could be other methods).\nOn Linux, it is as simple as issuing one of the following commands, assuming both the file and its signature are in the same folder (e.g. /path/to/the/files):\n\n    \n\n\n\nIf you try to verify the signature of a file without importing the associated public key, gpg throws a Can't check signature: No public key error:\n\n    \n\n\n\nNothing has been verified there, so you need to import the public key associated to the signature first.\nIn order to import the key, you need to first know where you can retrieve it from.\nThis is usually provided with the file and its signature or in the file installation documentation.\nOnce known, downloading and importing the key is as simple as issuing the following command:\n\n    \n\n\n\nBut how do you make sure the key you imported is the one you expected?\nKeys can be nested (as it is for Certificates Authorities used for HTTPS) and you can sign a key with another key.\nIf you want to deeply trust a key, you should start trusting its parent keys first.\nHere, we directly import the key we need which explain why we have the message no ultimately trusted keys found.\nIf we had imported and trusted the root key and imported all the intermediary keys the key which signed the file depends on if any, this message would not be there.\nMost of the time though, the key you import is standalone such as a root key (which has no parent).\nIn that case, the only thing you can do is to compare its fingerprint with the one provided (when it is provided) before trusting it.\nYou can also look for other sources of the public key to compare its fingerprint with.\nUsually, developers tend to put their public key in several independent places (public profiles, repos, websites, ...) so it might be possible to compare several fingerprints to prevent a bit more  public key tampering.\nYou can also check a public key fingerprint without importing it by downloading it and displaying its content:\n\n    \n\n\n\nIf you consider the key as trusted, you can import it with the following command:\n\n    \n\n\n\nLast but not least, You can retrieve the fingerprint of already imported keys with the following command:\n\n    \n\n\n\nPGP is all about building trust in a digital world.\ngpg is able to adapt its behavior depending on the level of trust you declare on each imported key.\nI won't go in the details of this feature as it should not be so useful in the case of a one-shot signature verification for the file unless you plan to do it regularly.\nIf you want to go deeper on this topic, you can look at the explanations and instructions provided by Qubes OS regarding signature verification which use nested keys and explains how to trust a key.\nNow keys are imported, let's verify the file again.\nIf the signature is valid, we have a Good signature successful message:\n\n    \n\n\n\nWe have a BAD signature error message otherwise:\n\n    \n\n\n\nIf the signature is valid, you can use the file safely.\nBut if it is not the case, I would strongly advise discarding the file.\nYou can try to download and verify it again, but if the bad signature persists, you should get in touch with the file provider before going further.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography ↩\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function ↩\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy
