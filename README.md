## A few development principles

All posts might be written both in English and French.

Commit messages should start with a type as follow:
- `zola`: a change to match a zola update (mainly for new version with breaking changes, no new feature introduction)
- `tabi`: a change to match a tabi update (for new version, no new feature introduction)
- `conf`: a change to the website configuration (no content)
- `blog`: a change to add a new post or update an existing one

All commit message should start with a verb after the type.
