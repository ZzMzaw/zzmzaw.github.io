I am just a geek living in France since a while and having a passion for IT, home automation, cybersecurity and privacy.

This blog is my small piece of the Internet where I write anything which is useful to me.

If it can be useful to me, it may be useful to someone else.

A lot of what I know comes from the Internet, this is also a way to contribute back.

You can find me in other places around the Internet but if you see a ZzMzaw not listed below, it might not be me.
