This is my very first blog post using Zola (<https://www.getzola.org/>) with tabi (<https://welpo.github.io/tabi/>) as a theme.

As anyone starting a new blog using a SSG [^1], I was about to write a first post on how I set it up.

Nevertheless, almost everything is already documented:
- How to install Zola:\
<https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/>
- How to configure Zola:\
<https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/configuration/>
- How to install a theme in Zola:\
<https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/>
- How to configure tabi:\
<https://welpo.github.io/tabi/blog/mastering-tabi-settings/>
- How to host a Zola website on Github Pages:\
<https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/>

All the information above makes setting a website similar to the one you're reading pretty straightforward.

Instead of rewritting what is already well written, I'll just explain how I ended up using Zola and tabi.

I really appreciate Rust [^2] programming language and I decided to look for an Rust-based FOSS [^3] SSG.

Zola was the first hit of my search.
It is not only FOSS but has also all the features I am looking for: multilingual, syntax highlighting, tags and shortcodes.

I played with Hugo (<https://gohugo.io/>) a few years ago and tried to create my own theme.
This was so time consuming that I gave up on both the theme and the blog...

I started to look around Zola's themes in order to avoid doing the same mistake twice.

I was looking for a minimalist theme, properly documented, able to work without javascript and at least, security conscious.

tabi just ticks all those boxes and even more.
Last but not least, tabi's maintainer is really open to contribution and I really appreciated the first one I did.

Anyway, this is the first step of a new adventure where I'll try to document what I do at home, both in English and French.

See you later...
